Version of Axelrod model with noise and social influence, and with
interaction now consisting of joint activity modelled as public goods
game, rather than original Axelrod interaction of simply focal agent
changing random fetaure to trait of interaction partner.

This version has co-operators co-operate with probability proportional
to cultural similarlity, rather than always as before. Defectors still
always defect.

This is derived from a copy of lattice-jointactivity-social-noise-cpp-end/ but now with co-operation probability based on cultural similarity added.


Derived originaly from Jens Pfau's c++ code for his Physica A paper from

http://ww2.cs.mu.oz.au/~pfauj/physicaa2012/physicaa2012-cpp.zip

modified by Alex Stivala to paralleize on MPI system using mpi4py
in conjunction with physica2012-python-mpi (modified version of Jens's 
Python scripts)
